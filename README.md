# The Energy Guard Web Application

## Overview

**The Energy Guard** is an industrial energy management web application developed during an internship with **Energy Guard** and **Coficab**. The application integrates IoT sensors and AI models to help users monitor, analyze, and optimize energy usage, enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two main components:

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js for the user interface and data visualization.
- **Backend**: Developed with Express.js and MongoDB for data processing and API management.

## Frontend

### Description

The frontend of The Energy Guard application provides a dynamic and responsive user interface. It visualizes energy data collected from IoT sensors and integrates with the backend to display real-time updates, historical trends, and predictive analytics.

### Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of energy consumption and key metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for energy usage trends and predictions.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live data feeds from IoT sensors.
- **User Controls**: Forms and controls for configuring settings and querying energy data.

### Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering interactive charts.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-energy-guard-frontend.git
   cd the-energy-guard-frontend

   ```bash
